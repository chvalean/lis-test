# VCPU_verify_online.sh
#
# Description:
#	This script was created to automate the testing of VCPU online or offline.
#   This script will verify if all the CPUs can be offline by checking
#	the /proc/cpuinfo file.
#	The VM is configured with 4 CPU cores as part of the setup script,
#	as each core can't be offline except vcpu0 for a successful test pass.
#
#	The test performs the following steps:
#		1. Configures the VM with 4 cores (see the test case XML definition)	
#		2. Make sure we have a constants.sh file.
#		3. Looks for the Hyper-v timer property of each CPU under /proc/cpuinfo
#		4. Verifies if each CPU can't be offline exinclude VCPU0.
#     
#	To pass test parameters into test cases, the host will create
#	a file named constants.sh.  This file contains one or more
#	variable definition.
#
# Note: The Host of Hyper-V 2012 R2 don't support the CPU online or offline, so
# To make sure the CPU on guest can't be offline.
